## Together we grow

### Background

Growthy serve as a mentor that prepares the user for the real world job market.
many people after graduation feel insecure and confused and do not know how to manage their focus in order to reach readiness in the job market, which often causes them to freeze or give up and compromise on non-field jobs that they often do not provide the adjustment and also in terms of salary.
Growthy learns each user by a questionnaire after which the user can choose one of the two options: a private mentor or a built-in program and all this according to the smart algorithm that Growthy learn about the user via the questionnaire,
Once the user selects a program the program is updated and he can track his progress, as well receive updates on job offers appropriate to his profile.

## The project's target

### The MVP is for Growthy Admin is to make a web pages for admin the users and the flow.

### As a admin:

- I would be able to see users
- I would be able to set goal, milestones, points and tasks to a user
- I would be able to see his progress, and progress of few users
- I would be able to see notification about users reaching milestones
- I would be able to send notification to all the users
- I would be able to send notification to specific user
- I would be able to add tasks to user

## Tech

This project uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Angular 12] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
- [Angular Material] - Material Design components for Angular
- [Ace Editor] - awesome web-based text editor
- This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.11.

## Development server

- Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

- Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

- Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

- Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

- Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

-To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
